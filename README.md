# Linux Labs – Fundamentals & SOC Analysis

This repository contains my hands-on Linux and security operations (SOC) practice.

## Labs Included

### 1. linux_basics.txt
Covers:
- Basic Linux navigation (`pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`)
- File permissions and `chmod`
- `sudo` and privilege escalation basics
- Log analysis using `journalctl`
- Authentication failures and successful login events
- SSH failed and successful login analysis
- Basic brute-force detection logic using logs

The goal of these labs is to build a strong foundation for:
- SOC Analyst / Blue Team work
- Incident response and log review
- Future work in cloud security and penetration testing

## How I Run These Labs

Environment:
- Kali Linux in VirtualBox
- Git used to track progress and push labs to GitHub

As I learn more (Nmap, Wireshark, processes, scripting, etc.), new lab files will be added here.
